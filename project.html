    <h2 style="text-align:center">Project 1 :- Online Voting System </h2>
     
     <p><b>Problem Statement : </b><br>
            Traditional voting systems face challenges such as inefficiency, security risks, and logistical issues. Voters often experience long queues, errors, and a lack of transparency, leading to disenfranchisement and fraud. There is a growing need for a secure, accessible, and user-friendly online voting platform that ensures transparency, privacy, and integrity in the voting process.</p>
            <p><b>How it works : </b><br>
                1) Registration: Users sign up with their details (email, password).<br>
                2) Login: Voters log in securely.<br>
                3) Vote: They select their choice (like a candidate) on the webpage.<br>
                4) Submit: The vote is sent and saved securely.<br>
                5) Confirmation: Voters get a message confirming their vote.<br>
                6) Results: After voting ends, results are counted and shown.<br>
